Setup
-----

The best way to do this is create a directory structure like this:

- build (clone of this git)
- documents (extra documents like PSD, doc, txt files that don't need to be included in the build)
- src (all the project files
   |
	|- documentation (directory with documentation files
	|- script (your script files)

Settings
--------

Change the build.properties file to work with this script:

dir.build: You'll don't need to edit this
dir.source: The path to your project source files
dir.publish: In what directory you want to create a release zip
